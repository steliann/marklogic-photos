	<description>One of the first monographs that Cartier-Bresson published was entitled 
	Images á la sauvette, released in France with a cover by Henri Matisse. In the United 
	States, the book was published by Simon and Schuster, with the title The Decisive Moment, 
	a phrase that has come to define the approach to photography that he perfected.
