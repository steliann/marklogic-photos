	<title>Nehru Announces Gandhi's Death, India, 1948</title>
	<description>After the war (during which he languished for three years in a German labor 
	camp before escaping) Cartier-Bresson began to travel the globe, documenting events in Asia, 
	Africa and North America. He was present for some of the most significant events of the 
	post-war era and displayed an uncanny knack for being in the right place at the right time. 
	In January 1948, he photographed Mahatma Gandhi right before the Indian leader was assassinated, 
	then covered the funeral that followed.
