	<title>L’Épuration</title>
	<description>On Sunday, as rain gently swept across its windows, I strolled through 
	the Quai Branly Museum’s new exhibition, Cheveux Chéris: Frivolités et Trophés 
	(‘Beloved Hair: Trophies and Trifles’). A series of photographs made me pause and ponder: 
	they showed l’épuration (purification or purge) where France rose up against Nazi 
	‘collaborators’. Taking a cue from the “purification” of Republican women in Spain in 
	the 1930s, French women who slept with the Germans were marched on to public squares and shaved.
