	<title>New York, 1947</title>
	<description>Cartier-Bresson came to America many times during his career. On one early 
	visit, he captured this extraordinary moment, as a mother and son, separated by the war, 
	are reunited in New York. One of the things that make this so moment so extraordinary is 
	the way the other people in the frame — and there are many of them — remain absorbed in 
	their own concerns, oblivious to the drama of the reunited family.
