	<title>Covering the D-Day</title>
	<description>The most famous images of that momentous day were made by Robert Capa. 
	When a LCVP (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel) from the U.S. Coast Guard-manned USS 
	Samuel Chase disembarked troops of the 16th Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division on 
	the morning of June 6, 1944 (D-Day) at Omaha Beach, Capa, in the employ of LIFE magazine, 
	was among them. He took four rolls of photos that day, but all but eleven of Capaâ€™s 
	negatives were spoiled by an overly eager darkroom worker in the London office of Time Inc. 
	who turned up the heat in the drying cabinet too high in his rush to meet the deadline 
	for the next issue of Life magazine.
