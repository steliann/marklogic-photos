	<title>To Those We Lost</title>
	<description>Fifty-seven years ago today died one of the first and brightest stars of 
	photojournalism — Robert Capa, the Hungarian-born visionary who defined the word 
	“war photographer”. In addition to covering the course of the Second World War in London, 
	North Africa, Italy, Normandy Landings and the Liberation of Paris, he reported from 
	four different wars: the Spanish Civil War, the Sino-Japanese War, Arab-Israeli War 
	and the First Indochina War. The above photo was the last one he took before he stepped 
	on a landmine in Indochina on May 25th 1954.
