	<description>In the catalogue to the show, Peter Galassi, MoMA's chief curator of photography 
	and the organizer of the exhibit, reproduces this image alongside the two on the roll 
	that precede it and follow it. What emerges is a small exegesis of how the photographer 
	worked. Having found his ideal arrangement of rice paddies and reflections, Cartier-Bresson 
	"waited until a turbaned woman appeared on the embankment pathway, perfectly positioned to anchor the image."
