	<description>The people depicted were flood victims. Bourke-White took the photo in 
	Louisville, Kentucky during her assignment to over the Ohio River flood of 1937. 
	The floods claimed nearly 400 lives and left roughly one million people homeless across 
	five states in the winter of that terrible year. The flood marked a catastrophic decade 
	in America which began with the Mississippi Floods of 1927, the Great Depression, and 
	the Dust Flood, straining Federal and local resources. A leviathan American state was 
	born to tackle these series of calamities.
