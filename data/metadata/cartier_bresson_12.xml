	<description>Galassi also provides the full contact sheet of the roll from which this 
	photo is drawn, along with an analysis of how the photographer's attention was drawn away 
	from the action in the bull ring and settled on the crowd and the toreadors beneath them. 
	Galassi observes, frame by frame, how the photographer shifts his camera until he gets just 
	the right balance of compositional elements, then waits for the definitive emotional moment. 
	Once he had it (and there is only one frame) he returned his eye to the bulls in the ring.
