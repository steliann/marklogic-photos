	<title>The Death of A Loyalist Militiaman</title>
	<description>Perhaps Robert Capa's most famous photograph, Death of a Loyalist Soldier, 
		which was taken in Cordoba, Spain in 1936. In his short life Robert Capa photographed 
		five wars, beginning in Spain in 1936, and finishing in 1954 during the French phase of 
		the Indo-China War, when he stepped on a land mine. In his collected work the period 
		becomes one continuing war, shifting from one front to another, the scale of the battle 
		expanding and contracting, but never quite ending.
