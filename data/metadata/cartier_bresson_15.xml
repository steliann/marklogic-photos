	<description>Contestants participate in a taping of the television show, To Tell the Truth. 
	One of the breathtaking qualities of the exhibit is the way that the photographs retain an 
	immediacy and modernity, while depicting places and events from long ago. In his introduction 
	to the catalogue, Galassi writes that the "panoramic scope" of Cartier-Bresson's work, "its 
	lusty curiosity, its acute responsiveness to the full panoply of human experience — and its 
	many masterpieces of photographic art — constitute a uniquely full and nourishing account of 
	the emergence of the modern world."</description>
