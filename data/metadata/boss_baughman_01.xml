	<description>That was an age dominated by foreign wars and widespread discrimination, 
	and Ross has almost Zeligian presence. He turns his lens towards American Nazis, Klansmen, 
	carnival freaks, transvestites, and mental patients; early crude and grisly days of 
	cosmetic surgery are chronicled. He befriends Robin Moore, the author of The Green Berets, 
	and The French Connection; when Israel invaded Lebanon, his byline tantalizingly 
	read, “North of Israeli Lines, Lebanon,” embedded as he was with Palestinian guerrillas 
	operating out of a secret base in the hills north of Israeli positions.
