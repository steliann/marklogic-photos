	<description>The war affected Dupain and his photography, by creating in him a greater 
	awareness of truth in documentary. In 1947, these feelings were reinforced when he read 
	a book Grierson on Documentary which defined the need for photography without pretence. 
	Dupain's documentary work of this period is exemplified in his photograph 
	"Meat Queue". He used a more naturalistic style of photography, "capturing a moment of 
	everyday interaction [rather than] attempting any social comment"
