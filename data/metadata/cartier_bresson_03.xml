	<title>Madrid, Spain, 1933</title>
	<description>The Leica that Cartier-Bresson carried held only 36 exposures at a time — 
	with no motor drive, of course — but his efficiency and economy were extraordinary. 
	He walked the streets with an almost Zen-like patience, hunting for the kinds of precise 
	shutter moments that now epitomize great photojournalism.
