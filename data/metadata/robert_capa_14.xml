	<title>Trotsky in Copenhagen</title>
	<description>In November 1932, Robert Capa was just a darkroom boy working at Dephot 
	(a famous photoagency that the time). His mentor had sent to him Copenhagen to cover a 
	speech being given there by the exiled Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky. However he took 
	those photos, Capaâ€™s skills were clear: he positioned himself near the speaker and 
	clandestinely snapped a series of photographs that captured the energy of the 
	impassioned Russian orator and the drama of the moment.
