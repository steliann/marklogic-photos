	<title>Valencia, Spain, 1933</title>
	<description>Consisting of close to 300 photographs, the Museum of Modern Art's exhibit, 
	"Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Modern Century," covers almost every aspect of the great 
	photographer's long career, beginning in the 1930s, when he abandoned an aspiration 
	to paint and picked up a camera instead. During this time, he flirted with the ideals 
	of the surrealist movement and it was his great insight that the Leica,
	a hand-held camera with a blink-of-an-eye shutter, was an ideal instrument with 
	which to capture, in an instant, the kinds of imagery that the surrealists strove for, 
	moments that went straight to the heart of the uncanny, much in the manner of this image, 
	taken at a bullring in Spain.
