	<title>Le Baiser de l’Hotel de Ville</title>
	<description>Although not as iconic as Alfred Eisenstaedt’s the sailor kiss on the V-E Day, 
	Robert Doisneau’s “The Kiss by the Hôtel de Ville,” taken on a Parisian street in 1950, 
	is considered one of the most romanticand popular photos ever taken. Although Doisneau 
	worked in Paris as a street photographer and stole many an intimate moment of Parisian 
	couples, this classic shot was staged. However, this fact didn’t prevent the picture 
	from gracing the walls of many freshman dorm rooms since its first production in 1986. 
	More than 500,000 posters and 400,000 postcards have been reprinted from the original.
